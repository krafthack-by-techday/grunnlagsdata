NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the Apache security team, saying \"It is by design that PHP allows scripts to process any request method.  A script which does not explicitly verify the request method will hence be processed as normal for arbitrary methods.  It is therefore expected behaviour that one cannot implement per-method access control using the Apache configuration alone, which is the assumption made in this report."}],"Metrics":{"CvssMetricV31":null,"CvssMetricV2":[{"Type":"Primary","CvssData":{"Version":"2.0","Vectorstring":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","AttackVector":null,"AttackComplexity":null,"PrivilegesRequired":null,"UserInteraction":null,"Scope":null,"ConfidentialityImpact":"PARTIAL","IntegrityImpact":"PARTIAL","AvailabilityImpact":"PARTIAL","BaseScore":7.5,"BaseSeverity":null},"BaseSeverity":"HIGH","ExploitabilityScore":10.0,"ImpactScore":6.4,"AcInsufInfo":false,"ObtainAllPrivilege":false,"ObtainUserPrivilege":false,"ObtainOtherPrivilege":true,"UserInteractionRequired":false,"Source":"nvd@nist.gov"}]},"Weaknesses":[{"Type":"Primary","Description":[{"Language":"en","Value":"NVD-CWE-Other"}],"Source":"nvd@nist.gov"}],"Configurations":[{"Nodes":[{"Operator":"OR","Negate":false,"CpeMatch":[{"Vulnerable":true,"Criteria":"cpe:2.3:a:php:php:4.4.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","VersionEndIncluding":null,"MatchCriteriaId":"84B70263-37AA-4539-A286-12038A3792C6"}]}]}],"References":[{"Url":"http://www.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=97","Source":"cve@mitre.org","Tags":["Vendor Advisory"]}],"VendorComment":null}}
