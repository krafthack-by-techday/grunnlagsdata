Symantec Norton AntiVirus (NAV) 2002 allows remote attackers to bypass e-mail scanning via a filename in the Content-Type field with an excluded extension such as .nch or .dbx, but a malicious extension in the Content-Disposition field, which is used by Outlook to obtain the file name.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this issue, acknowledging that the initial scan is bypassed, but Norton AntiVirus or the Office plug-in would detect the virus before it is executed"}],"Metrics":{"CvssMetricV31":null,"CvssMetricV2":[{"Type":"Primary","CvssData":{"Version":"2.0","Vectorstring":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","AttackVector":null,"AttackComplexity":null,"PrivilegesRequired":null,"UserInteraction":null,"Scope":null,"ConfidentialityImpact":"PARTIAL","IntegrityImpact":"PARTIAL","AvailabilityImpact":"PARTIAL","BaseScore":7.5,"BaseSeverity":null},"BaseSeverity":"HIGH","ExploitabilityScore":10.0,"ImpactScore":6.4,"AcInsufInfo":false,"ObtainAllPrivilege":false,"ObtainUserPrivilege":false,"ObtainOtherPrivilege":false,"UserInteractionRequired":false,"Source":"nvd@nist.gov"}]},"Weaknesses":[{"Type":"Primary","Description":[{"Language":"en","Value":"NVD-CWE-Other"}],"Source":"nvd@nist.gov"}],"Configurations":[{"Nodes":[{"Operator":"OR","Negate":false,"CpeMatch":[{"Vulnerable":true,"Criteria":"cpe:2.3:a:symantec:norton_antivirus:2002:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","VersionEndIncluding":null,"MatchCriteriaId":"8F6F3B3C-7C60-4A38-91F0-E09148DB4FD2"}]}]}],"References":[{"Url":"http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/1/260271","Source":"cve@mitre.org","Tags":null},{"Url":"http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/1/260678","Source":"cve@mitre.org","Tags":null},{"Url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/4246","Source":"cve@mitre.org","Tags":null},{"Url":"https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/8392","Source":"cve@mitre.org","Tags":null}],"VendorComment":null}}
