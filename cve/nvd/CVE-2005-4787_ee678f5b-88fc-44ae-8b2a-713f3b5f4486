NOTE: The vendor has disputed this issue, saying that \"Having this in the code makes it easier for us to troubleshoot when issues arise on individual carts. For someone to have a script to do this type of search would require that they know where your shop is actually located. I dont think it really can be construde [sic] as a security issue."}],"Metrics":{"CvssMetricV31":null,"CvssMetricV2":[{"Type":"Primary","CvssData":{"Version":"2.0","Vectorstring":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","AttackVector":null,"AttackComplexity":null,"PrivilegesRequired":null,"UserInteraction":null,"Scope":null,"ConfidentialityImpact":"PARTIAL","IntegrityImpact":"NONE","AvailabilityImpact":"NONE","BaseScore":5.0,"BaseSeverity":null},"BaseSeverity":"MEDIUM","ExploitabilityScore":10.0,"ImpactScore":2.9,"AcInsufInfo":false,"ObtainAllPrivilege":false,"ObtainUserPrivilege":false,"ObtainOtherPrivilege":false,"UserInteractionRequired":false,"Source":"nvd@nist.gov"}]},"Weaknesses":[{"Type":"Primary","Description":[{"Language":"en","Value":"NVD-CWE-Other"}],"Source":"nvd@nist.gov"}],"Configurations":[{"Nodes":[{"Operator":"OR","Negate":false,"CpeMatch":[{"Vulnerable":true,"Criteria":"cpe:2.3:a:turnkey_solutions:sunshop_shopping_cart:3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","VersionEndIncluding":null,"MatchCriteriaId":"5B43DF31-5B83-44B9-9A05-90E48766AB84"}]}]}],"References":[{"Url":"http://secunia.com/advisories/17832","Source":"cve@mitre.org","Tags":["Vendor Advisory"]},{"Url":"http://www.turnkeywebtools.com/forum/showpost.php?p=9874&postcount=6","Source":"cve@mitre.org","Tags":["Exploit"]},{"Url":"http://www.turnkeywebtools.com/forum/showthread.php?t=2384","Source":"cve@mitre.org","Tags":["Exploit","Patch"]}],"VendorComment":null}}
