This is fixed in 1.3.9, 2.1.3, and 2.2.3. Note that this vulnerability is not exploitable if the admin tools directory is removed, as recommended in the \"Post-installation and upgrade tasks\" of the MantisBT Admin Guide. A reminder to do so is also displayed on the login page.","type":"reviewed","severity":"medium","repository_advisory_url":null,"source_code_location":"https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt","identifiers":[{"value":"GHSA-x53v-v9xp-gf6g","type":"GHSA"},{"value":"CVE-2017-7241","type":"CVE"}],"references":["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-7241","http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=22568","https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/2d55c6476e939db021128b3995c28dcae05b09a4","https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/d31841c806a3c8379fcf6c9d9559451270b0f1cb","https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/ecef0e9b523a460709e8feedfce72f05bb30b992","https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x53v-v9xp-gf6g"],"published_at":"2022-05-17T02:30:07Z","updated_at":"2025-06-11T18:50:13Z","github_reviewed_at":"2025-06-11T18:50:10Z","nvd_published_at":"2017-03-31T04:59:00Z","withdrawn_at":null,"vulnerabilities":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"composer","name":"mantisbt/mantisbt"},"vulnerable_version_range":"< 1.3.9","first_patched_version":"1.3.9","vulnerable_functions":[]},{"package":{"ecosystem":"composer","name":"mantisbt/mantisbt"},"vulnerable_version_range":">= 2.0.0, < 2.1.3","first_patched_version":"2.1.3","vulnerable_functions":[]},{"package":{"ecosystem":"composer","name":"mantisbt/mantisbt"},"vulnerable_version_range":">= 2.2.0, < 2.2.3","first_patched_version":"2.2.3","vulnerable_functions":[]}],"cvss":{"vector_string":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","score":4.8},"cwes":[{"cwe_id":"CWE-79","name":"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"}],"credits":[]}
